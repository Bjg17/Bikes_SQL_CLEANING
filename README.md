#BIKE PURCHASING

In this project I have used SQL to clean a dataset which provided infromation about clients who did or didn't buy bikes. The data set came with valuable fields/variables, however I had to use my skills to determined which were essential, and which were not meaningful. I have also used my skills to alter and create crutial columns to achieve the outcome I was asked and I was expecting.
